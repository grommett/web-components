# Hello World with polyfill

## Question - How do I make my component respond to `attribute` changes?

With a pretty simple component we can repsond to `attribute` changes and update the content of our component pretty easily.

In this example I have some vanilla JS manipulating the component's `attribute` from the outside so we can see how the component responds.

Code is [here](./custom-element.js)
Vanilla JS, with polyfills, no imports.
